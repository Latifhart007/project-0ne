                <h3>Sobi Hill Ilorin</h3>
                <p>Sobi hills is the highest peak in Ilorin, at 394m above sea level, from itâ€™s top you can see almost every part of Ilorin emirate city. It derives its name from Sobi community in Ilorin, Kwara State. In addition to that, the landscape gently undulates, so there are pockets of trees and grassland amongst the rocky outcrops. The greenery and the altitude combine and make the air on the mountain fresh, like the atmosphere on a dewy morning. A perfect place for hiking and meditating.
                <br>Location: Sobi Rd, 240101, Ilorin, Kwara</p>
